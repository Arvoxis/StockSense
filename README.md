## 🎬 Demo

> Point your index finger at the camera and catch flying golden snitches in real time!

*(Add a GIF/screenshot of gameplay here — even a photo from the expo works great!)*

---

## 🎮 Features

- **Golden Snitch Chase** — Use your index finger to catch snitches flying across the screen
- **Real-time hand tracking** via MediaPipe — no controllers needed, just a webcam
- **Difficulty scaling** — snitches get faster as your score climbs
- **Combo system** — catch multiple snitches in quick succession for bonus points
- **Bludger obstacles** — avoid rogue bludgers or lose points
- **Power-ups** — special catches grant temporary abilities

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

| Library | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `opencv-python` | Video capture, rendering, frame processing |
| `mediapipe` | Real-time hand landmark detection |
| `numpy` | Coordinate math and array operations |

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7+
- A webcam
- Decent lighting (the hand tracker loves it)

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/Arvoxis/Harry-puttar-snitch-game.git

## 🕹️ How to Play

1. Run the script — your webcam feed will open
2. **Point your index finger** toward the camera
